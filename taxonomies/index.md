# Taxonomies

Taxonomy | Description
---------|------------
[Bulky items](bulky-items.html) | Common items authorities can collect.
[Collection events](collection-events.html) | Definitions of events that can happen during collection rounds.
[Container types](container-types.html) | They come in all shapes and sizes.
[Materials](materials.html) | Material categories and the items that can be included.


## Guidelines

The definition of taxonomy terms follows these conventions:

**DO**

* Use a capital at the start of a term.
* Use capitals for other words only if they are proper nouns.
* Separate related terms with an ampersand (&).
* Use generic names for products rather than brandnames, e.g. "vaccuum" instead of "Hoover".

**DON'T**

* Use "etc" at the end of a term.
