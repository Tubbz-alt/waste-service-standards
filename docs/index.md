## Approach

### Design principles

The project will follow the [API design guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/apis.html) from the [Government Service Design Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

### Technical standards

These technical specifications are used where relevant:

* The API is documented using [RAML](http://raml.org/).
* The APIs make use of [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/).
* Object models use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).
* [JSON Table Schema](http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/) are used for table definitions.
